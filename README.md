##	 What are we building:

#### We have a client with an [Animal Santuary](http://blackjaguarwhitetiger.org/visit-us/). 
* They want us to build software to keep track of the animals.  

* They recieve A LOT of animals. We need a way to quickly add more when they arrive.

* First [lets check out a few of their awesome animals](https://www.youtube.com/tv#/watch?v=vfCmzyLp26s&feature=youtu.be&t=439), so we know what are are in for.
